Please download and install glpk before running. 

Also, the python package pyomo is required to run the program. 

To run, please follow the following syntax:
	python csp_pyomo.py input.txt output.txt

The input files need to be formatted a certain way(single space to separate words, no empty lines)
for the program to work and so if any problems occur, please contact me.

Also, in sample 4, the preference for Griffin has only 8 numbers. I added a 0 to the end to make it work.
